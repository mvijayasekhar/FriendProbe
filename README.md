# FriendProbe
FriendProbe discovers life styles of users from user-centric sensor data,
measures the similarity of life styles between users, and recommends friends to
users if their life styles have high similarity. Inspired by text mining, we
model a userâ€™s daily life as life documents, from which his/her life styles are
extracted by using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm.
